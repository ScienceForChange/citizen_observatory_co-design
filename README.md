# Co-design service platform for citizen observatories

This space is intended to become a co-design knowledge hub, a meeting point for experts in design and Citizen Science that helps them idenfity their needs, select the strategies ant tools, rely on templates and guides, learn through past experiences of the community, etc.

The result of the experience gathered when co-designing the technical services for citizen observatories in the context of COS4CLOUD H2020 R+D+i Project is the foundation on top of which this platform is built.
